# School District Analysis
## Overview
The school board believes that the file shows evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School.  The grades appear to have been altered.  The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty and they have turned to Maria for help.  She has asked me to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.  After replacing the values, Maria would like the school district analysis repeated.
